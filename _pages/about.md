I'm a Ph.D. student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/people/backes) and [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). Prior to coming to CISPA, I received my Bachelor's degree from Sichuan University, where I daily worked with [Prof. Cheng Huang](https://www.chenghuang.org/). During my undergraduate, I was also a security engineer intern at Alibaba.

My research focuses on designing and developing trustworthy AI systems particularly in mitigating privacy risks and ensuring that their generated content is ethical, safe, and aligned with human values. I am also interested in the responsible use of AI, focusing on transparency and preventing the misuse of AI-generated content. Currently, I am passionate about building generative agents to address security and privacy tasks.
