I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/people/backes) and [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning, especially in the area of privacy attacks and the safety of AIGC.

Prior to coming to CISPA, I received my Bachelor's degree from Sichuan University, where I daily worked with [Prof. Cheng Huang](https://www.chenghuang.org/). During my undergraduate, I was also a security engineer intern at Alibaba.
